# Work Section Mobile Scrolling Fix

## Issue
The work section cards on the main page were preventing scrolling on mobile devices. Users could not scroll past the work section when trying to swipe over the cards.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by conflicting `touch-action` CSS properties and Framer Motion animations that were capturing touch events. The cards had `touch-action: pan-y` which was too restrictive and prevented the browser's native scrolling behavior.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/components/sections/WorkSection.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Changed `touch-action: pan-y` to `touch-action: auto` on mobile card wrapper
- Changed `touch-action: pan-y` to `touch-action: auto` on Link elements
- Changed `touch-action: pan-y` to `touch-action: auto` on work section container
- Changed `touch-action: pan-y` to `touch-action: auto` on motion.div title section
- Changed `touch-action: pan-y` to `touch-action: auto` on portfolio grid

**Why:** `touch-action: auto` allows the browser to handle all touch gestures naturally, including scrolling, while `pan-y` was restricting touch behavior and interfering with scroll momentum.

### 2. `/src/app/globals.css`
**Changes:**
- Updated `.work-section-container` mobile styles to use `touch-action: auto`
- Added rule for `.work-section-container .grid` to ensure `touch-action: auto`
- Added rule for `[data-framer-motion]` elements to ensure `touch-action: auto` and `pointer-events: auto`
- Added override to disable transforms during scroll: `body.scrolling .work-section-container a`

**Why:** These CSS changes ensure that:
1. The work section allows natural touch scrolling on mobile
2. Framer Motion elements don't interfere with scroll events
3. Transform animations are paused during active scrolling to prevent jank
4. All interactive elements within the work section respect native scroll behavior

## Technical Explanation

### The `touch-action` Property
- `touch-action: auto` - Default browser behavior, allows all touch gestures
- `touch-action: pan-y` - Restricts to vertical panning only, can block other gestures
- `touch-action: none` - Prevents all touch gestures (problematic for scrolling)

### Why `pan-y` Was Problematic
1. While `pan-y` should theoretically allow vertical scrolling, it can interfere with:
   - Native scroll momentum on iOS Safari
   - Browser's scroll optimization algorithms
   - Other touch gesture recognizers

2. Combined with Framer Motion animations and hover effects, `pan-y` created competing event handlers

### Solution Benefits
1. **Better scroll performance** - Browser handles scrolling natively without JavaScript interference
2. **Improved momentum** - iOS Safari's native momentum scrolling works correctly
3. **No gesture conflicts** - Touch events aren't captured by card hover effects
4. **Cross-browser compatibility** - Works consistently across Chrome, Safari, and Firefox mobile

## Testing Recommendations

Test on actual mobile devices (not just browser dev tools):
1. iPhone Safari - Test scroll momentum
2. Android Chrome - Test scroll smoothness
3. iPad - Test both touch and Apple Pencil
4. Test rapid scrolling through the work section
5. Test tapping cards while scrolling
6. Test scrolling with one finger starting on a card

## Additional Notes

The fix maintains all desktop functionality while improving mobile experience:
- Desktop hover effects still work
- Desktop scroll animations still work
- Mobile tap to navigate still works
- Mobile scroll momentum is now natural and smooth

All pointer-events-none decorative elements remain non-interactive, ensuring only the Link element captures clicks while allowing scroll events to pass through to the page.
